## 🔍 System Features

The system is designed for three user roles:

### **1️⃣ Student**

- Course registration and withdrawal
- View and print course schedule
- Request academic support (e.g., class expansion, enrollment approval)

### **2️⃣ Instructor**

- Manage personal teaching schedule
- Approve student enrollment requests
- View class rosters

### **3️⃣ Admin**

- Manage student and instructor accounts
- Open, modify, or remove courses and classes
- Process student and instructor support requests

## 📊 UML Diagrams Included

- **Use Case Diagram** (General & Decomposed Use Cases)
- **Class Diagram** (Entities and Relationships)
- **ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram)** (Database Schema)
- **Activity Diagrams** (Process Workflows)
- **Sequence Diagrams** (User Interactions)

## 📌 How to Use

1. Download the `SRS_Document.docx` to understand the system requirements.
2. Explore the `UML_Diagrams` folder for system models.
3. Use the diagrams for implementation or further development.
